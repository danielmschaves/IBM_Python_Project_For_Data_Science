## IBM Python Project For Data Science


## Project Overview
This project is focused on extracting financial data of popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop using Python libraries and web scraping. The goal is to collect historical share price and quarterly revenue reports and use the data to create a dashboard for visualizing patterns and trends.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed
In this project, we will be practicing the display of key performance indicators in a clear and concise manner. A dashboard will be created to display the extracted data and help identify key performance indicators. Plotly will be used for data visualization, but it is not a requirement to take this course.

## Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio
This project will use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio to complete the hands-on labs and assignment. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses, while Watson Studio is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy projects.
